        <p>Software Engineer by profession, explorer and hacker by nature.</p>

        <p>I do what I do because I like it and because it interests or entertains me. As a lot of people like me I tend
            to get
            distracted from my projects which get abandoned until I feel like coming back to them will interest me
            again.</p>

        <p>I love keeping myself occupied by learning new skills and this is the reason I am also an amateur mechanic,
            electronics
            designer, robot builder and photographer as well as a DIY guy in general. My motto is that if something can
            be done,
            given enough time
            and dedication I can do it too.</p>
