title: About

Software Engineer by profession, explorer and hacker by nature.

I do what I do because I like it and because it interests or entertains me. As a lot of people like me I tend to get
distracted from my projects which get abandoned until I feel like coming back to them will interest me again.

I love keeping myself occupied by learning new skills and this is the reason I am also an amateur mechanic, electronics
designer, robot builder and photographer as well as a DIY guy in general. My motto is that if something can be done, given enough time
and dedication I can do it too.
