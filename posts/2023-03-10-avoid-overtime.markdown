title: Avoid overtime
---

As software engineers we work very demanding jobs that regularly require from us to deal with ambiguity, solving complex
problems and reason about abstract concepts. We generally have 40-hour weeks, and pretty much always projects are running
behind schedule due to, in most cases, our own inability to estimate how long something would take to complete.

Many software engineers also love their jobs and their careers, we tend to take pride in our work and our accomplishments,
we really do want to build fantastic things, we want to be recognised as capable and excel at our jobs. You just have to 
look at the proliferation of way to compare your coding abilities to others, something as simple as your commit history in
GitHub but also much bigger such as HackerRank. Please don't take me wrong, this is, by itself, not a bad thing. We love what 
we do and for many, included me, codding is also a hobby, there is nothing wrong with it.

However, this industry unfortunately has no lack of people that work overtime and I have seen people working very long 
hours during my career (including of course myself). I am not talking about the occasional overtime, requested by
a nice manager to finish a critical project or the required work to fix a customer issue after hours. I am also not talking
about throwing all nighters to work on a new pet project that will never get anywhere but that is a lot of fun. I am talking
about the many people that regularly work for more than 8 hours, sometimes more than 12 or 15 because they feel they are
lagging behind; this hours are never reported or accounted for by the company and never remunerated.

This is often supported and even encouraged by the promotion structured established by big companies which aim to reward
individuals with big promotions when they meet certain, sometimes unreasonable, criteria. This deeply flawed promotion
process gets inevitably linked by the engineer to their professional self-worth, making achieving the next promotion a
big personal achievement, worth any sacrifice.

There are, in my opinion several drawbacks of regularly working overtime for your company:

- **You take time away from other things** you could do such as spending time friends and family but also, if you are
career inclined, working on things focussed on advancing your career such as learning new technologies, working on 
opensource or just exploring for fun.
- **You lower your own value and that of others** as the company does not remunerate you for your time, your time and that
of your peers becomes less valuable, by working overtime the company does not need to hire more engineers and as you don't
require payment for your extra work, why would they offer it?
- **It is a vicious cycle**. Quite often this extra work is unknown even by peers, as it is preferable to be seen as an 
engineer that gets things done fast and clean rather than one that struggles with a task over a whole weekend, this leads
to the size of tasks being hidden for future planning and the referenced time to completion being skewed. Now future you
as well as your peers have as a baseline tasks that were created working plenty of hidden overtime.
- **You become less efficient** when you are tired and this is particularly apparent on tasks that are considered as 
a constant trial and error; the task becomes repetitive, the brain enters in automatic and little to no progress is
made for many hours.
- **This inevitably leads to dissatisfaction** with your job and your career, which quite often ends with the person
quitting their job, sometimes after months of under-performing. This obviously being a bad outcome for both the
employee and the employer.

Good managers will always try to minimise the overtime the teams doby providing the right environment but the
competitive nature of the job and the careers do not make it easy, and it has become endemic to the industry.

This is, of course my own personal take and I can't speak for anyone's experience but I have seen a number of people
burnt by the job and, of you are reading this rambling I only ask...

**Take care of yourself.**
