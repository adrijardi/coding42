title: Lessons learnt on building a high performing team: Part 1
---

I am really lucky to work on my current team, they are a group of very brilliant people;
each on their own strengths and weaknesses, but each of them displays a fantastic desire
to learn and get better. That is, however, not the best the team can perform. As part of
my role I have tried to identify different areas of improvement which could bring 
significant improvement to the team's performance.

## What we have
- The team is fairly proficient on the technologies we use and they have a good level
of knowledge of most areas of the business and it's challenges.
- Working Scrum
- Wiliness to try new things

## What is on our way
- Unclear short and long term business goals which translate on the product team not
providing good user stories on time and often changes to work items while they are being 
worked on.
- Not fully working Scrum, there is often not enough work ready for developers at 
planning, leading to half full sprints, low pressure on the team, low motivation.
- Scrum not working well with our Continuous Delivery approach. We have to choose
between deploying all work at the end of the sprint, which will delay the acceptance 
to the user stories up to the end of the sprint, putting the sprint at risk of failure 
if something goes wrong; or deploying new functionality as soon as it it ready, which
can confuse stakeholders.
- The product owner has a hard time creating a cohesive set of stories with a clear
spring goal. 

## The process
We have been trying to improve the situation for a long time, this are some of the 
`solutions` we have tried, which various levels of success:

### Getting better user stories
Initially the quality of the user stories was not very high, in some cases, 
the intent wasn't clear, not enough information was available or it presented a 
solution or implementation details instead of a problem to solve. This caused confusion
and delays. A lot of effort from the product owner with help from the team made this a
problem of the past.

### Plan in advance
A lot of effort has been put towards clearer roadmaps, improving requirements
from the business, and planning, however any improvements on this regard have so 
far been only temporary and occurred when a large chunk of clear work was identified.
The company will continue to try improving in this area but currently the team still
has to deal with less than ideal conditions.

### Be more agile
It seems that a Scrum team doesn't match the needs of the business that well, we are
often not able to follow the methodology and it sometimes gets in the way of the 
company's needs and the Continuous Delivery practices. Therefore it has been decided
to adapt Kanban, while keeping parts from Scrum that help the team, like Scrum Poker 
for story points, daily standups,demos and possibly retrospectives (more on this 
on a next article).

The team will heavily focus on delivering value to the business as soon as possible and 
treat the agile methodology as a tool, adapting it and refining the processes to better
fit our needs.

The business and the product team will be able to better manage the work that is 
being done, they will have less pressure to create consistent groups of stories and
will be able to focus on delivering the pieces of work that are most valuable while
being 100% ready to work on.
