title: Farewell Adstream
---

I have worked for around 1 year and 9 months in Adstream where I started as a Scala Developer
and I have to say that for me it has been a wonderful experience.

When I started my Scala knowledge was limited (it still is, but I want to
believe that less so) and I got embarked on a bumpy ride where I had to deal with difficult
code and difficult people.

After some time I took on myself leadership responsibilities on one of the business critical projects,
and all together managed to create an excellent team which has been used as an example across the company.

We have, as a team, contributed to drive a massive change on the company culture, a lot has changed since
my early days here and now I feel that Adstream is an excellent place to work
that is full of opportunities to develop personally and professionally.

Sadly the time for me has come to move on, a new opportunity opened up for me out of the blue and
I feel that I have to take it.

I want to give my most sincere thanks to all my friends and colleagues from Adstream because they made
me really enjoy my time here, I'll carry you with me wherever I go and I will still come around for
lunch and drinks.




*So long and thanks for all the fish*
